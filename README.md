# credit-risk-classification

This challenge takes a dataset of historical lending activity to create a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

We undergo two main steps to train our model to make predictions

- Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data.

- Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data and the fitted model.

Once our model is ready we evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:

- Generate a confusion matrix.

- Print the classification report.

Our logistic regression model was able to predict a healthy loan ("0") with 100%. Whereas the model predicts high-risk loans ("1") with a 85%.
